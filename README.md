This project is a tool to profile your BizTalk orchestration, it is based on an old powerful tool with the same name that wasn't working anymore since BizTalk 2009.

**Enhancements :**

* Added the possibility to profile only a set of particular orchestration instances identified by their InstanceID
* Added BizTalk application filters (the tool wasn't usable when the BizTalk platform has many orchestrations deployed as you can imagine)
* Fixed timezone issues (The tool wasn't working when the system and SQL server were on two different timezones)

**How can i use it ?**
